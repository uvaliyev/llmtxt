# Document With Frontmatter

This document demonstrates frontmatter that llmtxt can strip when using the `-f` option.

## What is Frontmatter?

Frontmatter is metadata at the beginning of a document enclosed by `---` markers.
It's commonly used in static site generators and documentation systems.

## HTML Example

<div className="example">
  <h3>This is an HTML block</h3>
  <p>The clean option can remove these tags.</p>
</div>

## Additional Info

When using llmtxt, this file's frontmatter will be removed, and HTML tags can be stripped with the `-c` option.
